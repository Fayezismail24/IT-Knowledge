# Cable Types

Cable types are essential for determining how data will be transmitted within a network. Different cables have different characteristics in terms of speed, range, and environmental suitability. Here are some common cable types used in networking:

## 1. Twisted Pair Cables
- **Category 5 (Cat 5)**: Common in older networks, supports speeds up to 100 Mbps over a maximum length of 100 meters.
- **Category 5e (Cat 5e)**: An enhanced version of Cat 5, supports Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) over 100 meters.
- **Category 6 (Cat 6)**: Offers higher speeds (up to 10 Gbps for short distances) and improved resistance to crosstalk and interference.
- **Category 6a (Cat 6a)**: Enhanced Cat 6, supports 10 Gbps over longer distances (up to 100 meters).
- **Category 7 (Cat 7)**: Shielded, designed for higher frequencies and speeds, supports 10 Gbps at longer distances (up to 100 meters).

## 2. Coaxial Cable
- **Definition**: A cable with a single copper conductor at its center, surrounded by an insulating layer, shielding, and an outer protective layer.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for broadband internet connections and cable television.
- **Speeds**: Varies, but can support up to 10 Gbps in modern configurations.

## 3. Fiber Optic Cable
- **Single-mode fiber (SMF)**: Transmits data using a single light path, suitable for long-distance communication (up to 100 km or more).
- **Multi-mode fiber (MMF)**: Uses multiple light paths for shorter-distance communication (up to 2 km).
- **Advantages**: Offers extremely high bandwidth and very low signal loss, ideal for high-speed, long-distance data transmission.

## 4. USB Cables
- **Definition**: Used to connect devices like computers, smartphones, and other peripherals.
- **Versions**: USB 2.0 (480 Mbps), USB 3.0 (5 Gbps), USB 3.1 (10 Gbps), USB 4.0 (40 Gbps).
- **Usage**: Primarily for short-range data transfer and charging devices.

## 5. HDMI Cables
- **Definition**: High-definition multimedia interface cables primarily used for video and audio transmission.
- **Speeds**: HDMI 2.1 supports 48 Gbps for 8K video at 60Hz.
- **Usage**: Common in home entertainment systems, monitors, and TVs.

## 6. Power over Ethernet (PoE) Cables
- **Definition**: Ethernet cables that also transmit electrical power along with data.
- **Usage**: Used for devices like IP cameras, wireless access points, and VoIP phones.
- **Advantage**: Eliminates the need for separate power cables, simplifying installation.

## 7. Fiber Optic vs. Copper Cables
- **Fiber Optic**: Higher speeds and longer distances, resistant to electromagnetic interference.
- **Copper Cables**: More affordable, but have limitations in distance and speed compared to fiber optics.
